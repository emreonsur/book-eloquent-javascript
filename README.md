# Eloquent JavaScript – Study Repository

This repository is my personal workspace for studying the book **["Eloquent JavaScript, Fourth Edition" by Marijn Haverbeke](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)**.

## Structure

- [notes.md](notes.md) – Concept summaries, personal insights, and code snippets to support active learning.
- `code/` – Code examples adapted from the book and its [official website](https://eloquentjavascript.net/).
- `lab/` – A sandbox for experimentation, where I test ideas and explore concepts with additional code. I usually write and refine the snippets here before adding them to [notes.md](notes.md).
